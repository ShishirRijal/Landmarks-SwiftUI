# Landmarks - SwiftUI

## Project Overview

Landmarks is an iOS app designed for discovering and sharing favorite places. This SwiftUI-based project takes you through the process of creating and combining views to display a landmark's details, building lists and navigation for exploring a full list of landmarks, and handling user input to allow users to flag their favorite places.

## 1. Creating and Combining Views

The app uses stacks to combine and layer image and text view components. Additionally, a standard MapKit component is included to add a map to the view. Xcode provides real-time feedback to refine the view's design and see how changes translate into code.

## 2. Building Lists and Navigation

After setting up the basic landmark detail view, this section focuses on providing users with the ability to see the full list of landmarks and view details about each location. Views are created to display information about any landmark, and a scrolling list is dynamically generated. Xcode is used to render previews at different device sizes, allowing for fine-tuning of the user interface.

## 3. Handling User Input

In the Landmarks app, users can flag their favorite places and filter the list to show just their favorites. This section begins by adding a switch to the list, enabling users to focus on their favorites. Additionally, a star-shaped button is implemented for users to tap and flag a landmark as a favorite.
